# Sunglass-inator 🕶️

Are you tired of boring faces? Do you wish you could add some extra coolness to your photos? Well, fear not, my friend, for the Sunglass-inator is here to save the day! 🦸‍♀️

This Python project is a game-changer in the world of image manipulation. With the power of OpenCV and a pinch of sorcery, it can seamlessly overlay sunglasses onto any face it detects in an image. Prepare to witness the ultimate transformation from drab to fab! 🌟

## Usage

1. **Input:** Feed the Sunglass-inator with your boring, sunglasses-less image.

```python
image = cv2.imread('path/to/your/boring/image.jpg')
```

2. **Abracadabra!** Let the magic happen with a few lines of code.

```python
import sunglass_inator

sunglass_inator.make_it_cool(image, 'path/to/your/cool/sunglasses.png')
```

3. **Output:** Behold the awesomeness! Your image is now blessed with the coolest sunglasses ever. 😎

![Input Image](path/to/your/boring/image.jpg) → ![Output Image](path/to/your/cool/output.jpg)

## Features

- **Face Detection:** The Sunglass-inator can spot faces like a hawk, ensuring no one is left without a pair of shades.
- **Automatic Sizing:** It resizes the sunglasses to fit each face perfectly, because one size doesn't fit all (except for coolness).
- **Alpha Channel Support:** Transparency? No problem! The Sunglass-inator handles alpha channels like a pro.
- **Multi-Face Support:** Got a group photo? The Sunglass-inator will make sure everyone looks equally cool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- A good sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas to make the Sunglass-inator even cooler (pun intended), feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make the world a more fashionable place, one pair of sunglasses at a time. 😎🌍
